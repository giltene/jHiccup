#
# jHiccup is a platform pause measurement tool, it is meant to observe the
# underlying platform (JVM, OS, HW, etc.) responsiveness while under an
# unrelated application load, and establish a lower bound for the stalls
# the application would experience. It is run as a wrapper around
# other applications so that measurements can be done without any changes
# to application code.
#
# The purpose of jHiccup is to aid application operators and testers in
# characterizing the inherent "platform hiccups" (execution stalls)
# that a Java platform will display when running under load. The hiccups
# measured are NOT stalls caused by the application's code. They are stalls
# caused by the platform (JVM, OS, HW, etc.) that would be visible to and
# affect any application thread running on the platform at the time of the
# stall.It is generally safe to assume that if jHiccup experiences and
# records a certain level of measured platform hiccups, the application
# running on the same JVM platform during that time had experienced
# hiccup/stall effects that are at least as large as the measured level.
#
# jHiccup's measurement works on the simple basis of measuring the time it
# takes an effectively empty workload to perform work (while running alongside
# whatever load the platform is carrying). Hiccup measurements are performed
# by a thread that repeatedly sleeps for a given interval (-r for resolutionMs,
# defaults to 1 msec), and logs the amount of time it took to actually wake up
# each time in a  detailed internal hiccup histogram. The assumption is that
# if the measuring thread experienced some delay in waking up, any other thread
# in the system could/would have experienced a similar delay, resulting in
# application stalls.
#
# jHiccup generates two log files: and sequential log file and a histogram log
# file (by default hiccup.YYMMDD.HHMM.pid and  hiccup.YYMMDD.HHMM.pid.hgrm
# the -l <logname> can be used to override the log file name).
# The sequential log file logs a single %'ile stats line for each reporting
# interval (set with -i <reportingIntervalMs>, defaults to 5000 msec).
# The histogram log file includes a detailed %'ile histogram of the run so far.
# A new histogram log file will be produced each interval, and will replace the
# one generated in the previous interval.
#
# jHiccup can be configured to delay the start of measurement
# (using the -d <startDelayMs> flag, defaults to 30000 msec).
#
# jHiccup will continue to run until the application it is wrapping exists.
#
# Using the -c option (off by default), jHiccup can be configured to launch
# a concurrently executing "control process" that will separately log hiccup
# information of an idle workload running on a separate jvm for the duration
# of the instrumented application run. When selected, the control process log
# file names will match those used for the preceded application, preceded
# with a "c.".
#
# For convenience in testing, jHiccup is executed as a simple wrapper for
# java program execution. All it takes is adding the word "jHiccup" in front
# of whatever the java invocation command line is.
#
# For example, if your program were normally executed as:
#
# java <Java args> UsefulProgram -a -b -c
#
# The launch line would become:
#
# jHiccup java <Java args> UsefulProgram -a -b -c
#
# or, for a program that is launch like this:
#
# /usr/bin/java <Java args> -jar UsefulProgram.jar -a -b -c
#
# The launch line would become:
#
# jHiccup /usr/bin/java <Java args> -jar UsefulProgram.jar -a -b -c
#
# or, to override the defaults by making the recording start delay 60 seconds
# and log to logfiles hlog and hlog.hgrm, it would become:
#
# jHiccup -d 60000 -l hlog /usr/bin/java <Java args> -jar UsefulProgram.jar -a -b -c
#

# Figure out installed path:
# On Linux, we'd do the following:
# PARSED_SCRIPT=`readlink -f $0`
# INSTALLED_PATH=`dirname $PARSED_SCRIPT`
# But readlink -f doesn't work the same everywhere (e.g. Mac OS). We use this instead:
function readlink_f () { _=`pwd`; cd `dirname $1` && echo `pwd` && cd $_; }
INSTALLED_PATH=$(readlink_f $0)
